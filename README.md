# 4.Findings and Recommendations 

# Summary of Findings 

Revenue is driven by a handful of top products — Portable Refrigerator Freezer and Solar Generator together contribute over 100,000 in revenue. 

There is a long tail of underperforming products generating minimal sales, which increases inventory holding costs. 

Categories like Food - Cooking Oils, Canned Soups, and Pantry deliver the strongest margins and should be prioritized. 

Both Online and In-Store channels are equally valuable, each representing about half of revenue. 

# Recommendations 

Focus Inventory on High-Performers: 

 Maintain strong stock levels for top-selling products like the Portable Refrigerator Freezer and Electric Bike, which have steady demand. 

Review and Rationalize Underperforming Products: 

 Evaluate whether to discontinue low-revenue items like Cinnamon Raisin Bagels and Dark Chocolate Covered Pretzels, or run promotions to clear excess stock. 

Double Down on High-Margin Categories: 

 Expand marketing and purchasing for top-margin categories, such as Cooking Oils and Canned Soups, to protect and grow profit margins. 

Balance Channel Promotions: 

 Use the 50/50 channel split insight to design balanced promotional strategies — for example, push online exclusives for high-margin products while offering in-store bundles for slower movers. 

Monitor Regional Gaps: 

 From the Regional Performance page, regions like Wales and East Midlands show higher revenue and lower average discounts — these can be used as benchmarks for underperforming areas. 

 

# Conclusion 

The Power BI dashboard answers all four business questions clearly and is backed by meaningful visual evidence: 

Top 5 and underperforming products are identified, 

Highest-margin product categories are clear, 

Sales distribution across channels is easy to interpret, 

Findings are supported with actionable recommendations for sales, marketing, and inventory teams. 

This insight-driven approach will help Ace Superstore focus on high-impact areas and maximize profitability moving forward.
